## Description
This project is the eleventh challenge of a bootcamp where students had to implement:

 * An application that can be used to write and save notes
 * The app will use Express Js to retrieve, save and delete data from a JSON file
 * NPM's uuid package is used to generate random ids for each note
 * The app uses modular routing to keep the code well organised and easy to maintain over time

## Usage 
 The following video demonstrates how to use the application:
